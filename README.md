# HUE2

A public version of HUE for community development!

## The developers
We don't have so much time to spend on this project, sadly.
However, our thought has been to recreate HUE into something that more people can join in on.
The design choices we've made in the recreation HUE -> HUE2 is mostly due to this.

Even right now it has been an effort of recreating it to its barebones just because we're swamped with other things.
The important thing is that the project gets released but that means that some of the bugs we've squashed before has now reemerged.

Please help us with this!

Just by adding issues you contribute. And hopefully some of you can even help squashing the bugs.

## Design choices

- Written in Go.
  - It is a compiled language -> smaller executables than e.g. python.
  - Good for creating web applications
  - Greater flexibility with objects (you have pointers and so on).
  - However, still relative simple to learn. Not much more complicated than Python.
- GUI is pure HTML/CSS/JS
  - A lot of people know HTML/CSS thus, hopefully, people in the community who are knowledgeable in web-design can contribute without any programming knowledge.
